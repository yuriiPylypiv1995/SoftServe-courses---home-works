Zen of Python!

1.Beautiful is better than ugly. 

2.Explicit is better than implicit.

3.Simple is better than complex.

6.Sparse is better than dense.

7.Readability counts.

8.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

9.Although practicality beats purity.

12.In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

13.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

14.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

16.Although never is often better than *right* now.

17.If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

19.Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

50.eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
24.Flat is better than nested.
